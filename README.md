## 🧠 AI/ML Integration

### 🔹 Credit Risk Assessment
A supervised machine learning model (Logistic Regression) trained on synthetic credit data to evaluate loan eligibility based on income, age, balance, etc.

> Endpoint: `POST /credit-analysis`

### 🔹 Fraud Detection
Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest to identify unusual transaction patterns.

> Endpoint: Automatic detection during transaction registration

### 🔹 Smart Product Recommendation
Cluster-based recommendation (K-Means) based on user profile and behavior.

> Endpoint: `GET /recommendations/{userId}`
